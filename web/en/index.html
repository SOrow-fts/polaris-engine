<h2 class="spacer">Statement: The World Polaris Engine Aim For</h2>
<p>
	In the late 1990s and early 2000s,
	software such as Kirikiri/KAG and NScripter led the doujin
	and commercial visual novel market and helped the industry grow.
</p>
<p>
	However, after the major gaming platform shifted to smartphones in the 2010s,
	no standard software was created to run visual novels on smartphones.
</p>
<p>
	This was due to the market's observation that light games would be replaced by HTML5 technology.
	Thus, many of the visual novel engines that emerged in the 2010s were web technologies.
	However, the future of light games being HTML5-based did not arrive.
	There are hybrid apps that mix web and native technologies,
	but HTML5 never became a mainstream game technology.
	As a result, until October 2023, there was no standard software that can easily bring visual novels to smartphones.
	That kind of software was missing.
</p>
<p>
	Polaris Engine is something that has never existed anywhere before.
	Namely, it is open source, cross-platform including smartphones,
	and runs natively, not on the Web or Python.
	Polaris Engine is the first visual novel engine with these features
	that can be used for both doujin and commercial purposes.
</p>
<p>
	Polaris Engine encourages the creation of games by individuals and doujin,
	and expands the platform on which these works are published, from PC and Web, to smartphones.
</p>
<p>
	Polaris Engine makes it easy for popular works to generate revenue on smartphone app stores.
	By establishing a scheme that allows unique creators to generate revenue,
	Polaris Engine aims to create a small market that will eventually grow into a large industry.
</p>
<p>
	Polaris Engine ultimately envisions a world where just a single computer becomes a great production tool for the disadvantaged.
	This will break out of the stagnation that has prevailed in Japan for the past 30 years.
	It will also bring prosperities to developing countries.
	That is the innovation we will realize.
</p>
